# Sentiment Analysis Using Bert on Movie Reviews
 This project leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, aiming to accurately gauge audience emotions and preferences. By utilizing advanced NLP techniques and machine learning models, the analysis classifies reviews as positive or negative, enhancing the understanding of customer sentiment and improving decision-making for movie-related businesses.  Key Features Data Collection: Use a dataset of movie reviews from sources like Kaggle. Preprocessing: Clean and normalize review text, handling punctuation, stopwords, and noise. BERT Model: Fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification, achieving high accuracy. Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualization: Present results through graphs, confusion matrices, and sentiment distribution plots. Technologies Used Python Pandas, NumPy Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch Hugging Face Transformers NLTK, SpaCy Matplotlib, Seaborn
